This is a quick solution, because sometimes we don’t want to refactor a function component’s concise function body back to a block body to define an appropriate handler between function signature and return statement.
While this way is more concise than the others, it can also be more difficult to debug because JavaScript logic may be hidden in JSX. 
It becomes even more verbose if the wrapping arrow function encapsulates more than one line of implementation logic, by using a block body instead of a concise body.
